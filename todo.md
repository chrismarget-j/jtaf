# To Do:
- figure out candidate vs. running datastore stuff
- add git commit and git tag variables
- collect hash of yang data
- calculate provider name
- ~~clone url.QueryEscape so that it works for our characters~~
- ~~semaphore for client transactions~~
- eliminate path attribute for top-level resources
- introduce function to convert XML config attributes to terraform attributes
  - ~~Figure out whether any yang leafs begin with non-alpha characters~~
  - e.g. `native-inner-vlan-id` -> `native_inner_vlan_id`
  - lots of leaf nodes (5000+) contain `-` (0x2d) - need to handle these
  - filtering with this regex `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$` leaves only:
    - `inet.0`
    - `inet6.0`
    - `inet6.3`
    - `to-802.1p-from-dscp`
  - no leaf nodes begin with something other than `a-z` and `A-Z`
  - looks like we need to handle only `-` (0x2d) and `.` (0x2e)
- set XMLName on everything (remove parent struct tag?)
- reintroduce 'id' attribute as hash of xpath
